## 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 ⚽️ Introduction

Selected 2023-24 statistics of the top-flight league of professional Scottish football, the Scottish Premiership.

The table is built from three scripts run in sequence, although the first can be skipped after the first run:

1.  `0_collect_timeseries.R`: Collecting time series data back to the 2000-01 season.

2.  `01_spfl_collect_data.R`: Wrangling the data, and calculating summary statistics

3.  `02_build_table_gt.R`: Building the table

[The repo with these scripts can be found here.](https://github.com/dplloyd/posit-table-comp-2024)

```{r}

library(tidyverse)

source("0_collect_timeseries.R")

source("01_spfl_collect_data.R")

source("02_build_table_gt.R")
```

## Data source

## Table

The table is built in `gt` and `gtExtra`. I relied heavily on the latter's help files, and [Albert Rapp's](https://gt.albert-rapp.de) tutorial on creating plots within table cells, and I particularly wanted to explore how sparklines and other in-cell plots can help summarise tabular data. While I didn't exploit the functionality of embedding `ggplot2` objects in cells, I think that route would help in future iterations, and exploring other variables to summarise.

```{r}
final_table
```
